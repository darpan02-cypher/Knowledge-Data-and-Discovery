Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination.\\nDon't look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there (although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President's attention. What's even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on. He's nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it's a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn't have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who. In the climactic \\\"match,\\\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \\\"cornball,\\\" you ain't seen nothin' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn't boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n\",\n          \"In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \\\"Needful Things.\\\" Most of Castle Rock's residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \\\"Needful Things\\\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people's greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given.\\nIt's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work, instead relying on \\\"Ave Maria\\\" and Grieg's \\\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n\",\n          \"Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M.

At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \\\"nice guy\\\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \\\"wailing wall\\\" to the \\\"City of the World\\\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there's so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \\\"good ol' boy\\\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate's cruel whims.\\nThe film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination.\\nDon't look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there (although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President's attention. What's even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on. He's nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it's a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn't have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who. In the climactic \\\"match,\\\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \\\"cornball,\\\" you ain't seen nothin' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn't boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n\",\n          \"In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \\\"Needful Things.\\\" Most of Castle Rock's residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \\\"Needful Things\\\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people's greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given.\\nIt's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work, instead relying on \\\"Ave Maria\\\" and Grieg's \\\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n\",\n          \"Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M. Emmet Walsh, Charles Durning, Joel Grey Director: Philip Haas Producers: Frederick Zollo and Dylan Sellers Screenplay: Philip Haas and Belinda Haas based on the novel by Paul Auster Music: Phillip Johnston Released by I.R.S Releasing and Trans Atlantic Entertainment\\nOn the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled stranger. This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a professional gambler. As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming \\\"sure thing\\\" poker game. Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He'll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \\\"nice guy\\\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \\\"wailing wall\\\" to the \\\"City of the World\\\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there's so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \\\"good ol' boy\\\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate's cruel whims.\\nThe film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

happened the movie doesnt know where to go with the story so it turns to the old hollywood standbys of a pyrotechnics show a lot of dumb dialogue and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many\\nthe final scene isnt the problem its the one that immediately precedes it this is so dumb that i felt like yelling at the screen the big payoff in needful things is a gyp and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches those that sit through this picture deserve more than theyre given\\nits too bad about the climax because the bulk of the overlylong film shows promise there are the usual horror staples like the meat cleaver in the head and the shocktactic swell of music but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands the terror here is more psychological than physical and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of castle rock leland gaunt only causes it to surface\\nmax von sydow is an inspired casting choice and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about needful things he manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience offbalance hes the bad guy all righttheres never any doubt about thatbut hes so cultured and smooth and delivers the oneliners so bitingly that its almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him certainly its von sydows rendering of gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious\\ned harris bonnie bedelia and amanda plummer have shown great ability in the past but none of that is evident here the best of the three is bedelia and her role is relatively small plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature harris whos supposed to be playing the heroic lawman is about as potent as a limp noodle\\nif he hasnt done so well with three of the four main actors at least firsttime feature director fraser c heston son of charlton can boast excellent cinematography by tony westman and a creepy atmosphere needful things consistently looks nice even during its most banal scenes some of the choppy pacing is clearly hestons fault but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame\\nin the three kenneth branagh films he scored henry v dead again and this summers much ado about nothing patrick doyle showed significant versatility and range sadly the same ability is not in evidence here where doyle reworks his dead again music into an overwrought theme that at best does little for the film there are a couple of effective musical sequences but neither uses doyles work instead relying on ave maria and griegs in the hall of the mountain king\\nneedful things is another example of a good idea gone awry this seems to happen with alarming frequency when a stephen king story is involved since im not a fan of mr king and cant claim to more than occasionally read his work its difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books whatever the case in leland gaunt needful things wastes one of the years most intriguing villains this is a case of a film building to an apex that isnt there by the time the end credits roll a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything sadly the answer is yes but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of max von sydow\\n\",\n          \"starring mandy patinkin james spader m emmet walsh charles durning joel grey director philip haas producers frederick zollo and dylan sellers screenplay philip haas and belinda haas based on the novel by paul auster music phillip johnston released by irs releasing and trans atlantic entertainment\\non the way to new york city james nashe mandy patinkin stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beatup and bedraggled stranger this man turns out to be jack pozzi james spader a professional gambler as the two get to talking pozzi tells nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming sure thing poker game intrigued by the idea of some quick easy money nashe offers pozzi a proposition hell advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fiftyfifty the deal is struck and the two are off to the rural pennsylvania residence of flower and stone charles durning and joel grey where the games begin\\nthe music of chance is a film of many levels at its most literal it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences which include building a tenthousand stone wall however those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience while final scene dripping with meaning gives the picture closure very little is resolved and there are a lot of questions left unanswered\\npeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it there you will find other questions but these are of a far more imposing and thoughtprovoking nature the music of chance explores how one moment can forever alterand perhaps destroylives it also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust\\nat the center of the story are three characters james nashe is the basic nice guy who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost he is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves on the other hand his mismatched partner jack pozzi is unwilling to accept the blame for anything he would rather shift it to fate chance or anything else he can make a connection with calvin murks m emmet walsh represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny\\nmetaphors abound from the wailing wall to the city of the world being built by willie stone in fact theres so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning there are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story\\ncharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces and necessary to understanding any of what happens during the music of chance as obscure as some of the plot may be jack and james are completely understandable calvin murks starts out as something of an enigma but as the film progresses clues about his real nature slip out\\njames spader cast against type is completely believable as the unsavory and difficulttolike jack m emmet walsh does his usual good ol boy routine with a nasty sadistic twistsomething he presents in a subtleyetdistinctive manner the standout however is mandy patinkin who with little fanfare captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of james nashe the man trapped and battered by fates cruel whims\\nthe films conclusion is its greatest weakness aside from being relatively predictable it isnt entirely satisfactory movies such as this dont have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together nevertheless the music of chance might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on and how it all ends up\\nthe music of chance did not receive wide release because in spite of a wellknown cast it is not a movie for mass consumption after all how many people out for an evenings light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionallypompous intellectual film about poker and wall building nevertheless as is often the case with movies such as this theres more to the music of chance than can be seen with the first casual glance an investment of time is needed and for the most part rewarded\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination.\\nDon't look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there (although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President's attention. What's even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on. He's nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it's a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn't have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who. In the climactic \\\"match,\\\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \\\"cornball,\\\" you ain't seen nothin' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn't boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n\",\n          \"In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \\\"Needful Things.\\\" Most of Castle Rock's residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \\\"Needful Things\\\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people's greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given.\\nIt's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work, instead relying on \\\"Ave Maria\\\" and Grieg's \\\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n\",\n          \"Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M. Emmet Walsh, Charles Durning, Joel Grey Director: Philip Haas Producers: Frederick Zollo and Dylan Sellers Screenplay: Philip Haas and Belinda Haas based on the novel by Paul Auster Music: Phillip Johnston Released by I.R.S Releasing and Trans Atlantic Entertainment\\nOn the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled stranger. This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a professional gambler. As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming \\\"sure thing\\\" poker game. Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He'll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \\\"nice guy\\\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \\\"wailing wall\\\" to the \\\"City of the World\\\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there's so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \\\"good ol' boy\\\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate's cruel whims.\\nThe film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

come to abrupt and inexplicable deadends not that youre likely to care but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with luis girlfriend dianna stacey travis or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep luis in line\\nthere are also a number of transitional scenes that arent there although where they got left out i dont knowthey could be on the cutting room floor for example one moment dianna is explaining to luis that theyre no longer kids and while she admires what hes trying to do its over between them since she has a new boyfriend nevertheless shortly thereafter the two are getting awfully intimate talk about a jarring turn of events\\nthen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who predictably get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher somebody should bring this miracle worker to the presidents attention whats even more astounding is that luis never gets stabbed or shot there are some token guns and knives in evidence but nothing close to what youd expect at the high school from hell guns you see would have gotten in the way of the message not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys\\nspeaking of which the script does everything it possibly can to make silverio the meanest hombre youve ever laid eyes on hes nasty sadistic and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat he deals drugs and runs a chop shop we never see him kill anyone but its a given that murder is on his resume heck for all we know he eats orphans for breakfast even i cynical viewer that i am felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this satan incarnate\\nactually paco christian prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guyif youre looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt i kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his wellmuscled chest which he like the hero shows off at every possible opportunity mark dacascos is also passable especially when he doesnt have to talk geoffrey lewis who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and tv shows does an absolutely embarrassing job as the goodhearted teacher kerrigan\\nmost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch at least compared to the rest of the movie although sometimes the action goes so fast that its difficult to figure out whos who in the climactic match the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other but even that doesnt eliminate all the confusion\\nfor those who thought the ending of scent of a woman was pure cornball you aint seen nothin yet take a look at the final scene of only the strong and youll note that its got pacinos film beaten by a long stretch of course theres a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to\\nthere is one good thing that i can say about only the strong it isnt boringor at least not too boring the message it tries to get acrossthat kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangsis laudable but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful if you want somebody to listen youd better put together something worth listening too not a movie stopping ohsobriefly in the theaters on the way to the video store\\n\",\n          \"in the quiet new england town of castle rock an unassuming elderly man by the name of leland gaunt max von sydow has arrived to open an antique shop called needful things most of castle rocks residents discover some rare and coveted treasures withina  mickey mantle baseball card for a young boy a china figurine for a slightly offbalance woman a magnificent chalice for a priest and a necklace that can take away an arthritics pain the price asked by mr gaunt is always more than reasonable at least where money is concerned and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal so be it the only one immune to needful things appears to be alan pangborn ed harris the local chief of police so when the carnage starts its up to him to stop it\\nhow is it that a film with a good cast stylish direction and camera work and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question needful things would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is\\nwhat at the outset is the films strength turns into its greatest liability the basic concept is solid a gentleseeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite peoples greed to turn them against one another unfortunately once that has happened the movie doesnt know where to go with the story so it turns to the old hollywood standbys of a pyrotechnics show a lot of dumb dialogue and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many\\nthe final scene isnt the problem its the one that immediately precedes it this is so dumb that i felt like yelling at the screen the big payoff in needful things is a gyp and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches those that sit through this picture deserve more than theyre given\\nits too bad about the climax because the bulk of the overlylong film shows promise there are the usual horror staples like the meat cleaver in the head and the shocktactic swell of music but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands the terror here is more psychological than physical and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of castle rock leland gaunt only causes it to surface\\nmax von sydow is an inspired casting choice and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about needful things he manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience offbalance hes the bad guy all righttheres never any doubt about thatbut hes so cultured and smooth and delivers the oneliners so bitingly that its almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him certainly its von sydows rendering of gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious\\ned harris bonnie bedelia and amanda plummer have shown great ability in the past but none of that is evident here the best of the three is bedelia and her role is relatively small plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature harris whos supposed to be playing the heroic lawman is about as potent as a limp noodle\\nif he hasnt done so well with three of the four main actors at least firsttime feature director fraser c heston son of charlton can boast excellent cinematography by tony westman and a creepy atmosphere needful things consistently looks nice even during its most banal scenes some of the choppy pacing is clearly hestons fault but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame\\nin the three kenneth branagh films he scored henry v dead again and this summers much ado about nothing patrick doyle showed significant versatility and range sadly the same ability is not in evidence here where doyle reworks his dead again music into an overwrought theme that at best does little for the film there are a couple of effective musical sequences but neither uses doyles work instead relying on ave maria and griegs in the hall of the mountain king\\nneedful things is another example of a good idea gone awry this seems to happen with alarming frequency when a stephen king story is involved since im not a fan of mr king and cant claim to more than occasionally read his work its difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books whatever the case in leland gaunt needful things wastes one of the years most intriguing villains this is a case of a film building to an apex that isnt there by the time the end credits roll a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything sadly the answer is yes but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of max von sydow\\n\",\n          \"starring mandy patinkin james spader m emmet walsh charles durning joel grey director philip haas producers frederick zollo and dylan sellers screenplay philip haas and belinda haas based on the novel by paul auster music phillip johnston released by irs releasing and trans atlantic entertainment\\non the way to new york city james nashe mandy patinkin stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beatup and bedraggled stranger this man turns out to be jack pozzi james spader a professional gambler as the two get to talking pozzi tells nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming sure thing poker game intrigued by the idea of some quick easy money nashe offers pozzi a proposition hell advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fiftyfifty the deal is struck and the two are off to the rural pennsylvania residence of flower and stone charles durning and joel grey where the games begin\\nthe music of chance is a film of many levels at its most literal it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences which include building a tenthousand stone wall however those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience while final scene dripping with meaning gives the picture closure very little is resolved and there are a lot of questions left unanswered\\npeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it there you will find other questions but these are of a far more imposing and thoughtprovoking nature the music of chance explores how one moment can forever alterand perhaps destroylives it also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust\\nat the center of the story are three characters james nashe is the basic nice guy who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost he is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves on the other hand his mismatched partner jack pozzi is unwilling to accept the blame for anything he would rather shift it to fate chance or anything else he can make a connection with calvin murks m emmet walsh represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny\\nmetaphors abound from the wailing wall to the city of the world being built by willie stone in fact theres so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning there are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story\\ncharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces and necessary to understanding any of what happens during the music of chance as obscure as some of the plot may be jack and james are completely understandable calvin murks starts out as something of an enigma but as the film progresses clues about his real nature slip out\\njames spader cast against type is completely believable as the unsavory and difficulttolike jack m emmet walsh does his usual good ol boy routine with a nasty sadistic twistsomething he presents in a subtleyetdistinctive manner the standout however is mandy patinkin who with little fanfare captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of james nashe the man trapped and battered by fates cruel whims\\nthe films conclusion is its greatest weakness aside from being relatively predictable it isnt entirely satisfactory movies such as this dont have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together nevertheless the music of chance might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on and how it all ends up\\nthe music of chance did not receive wide release because in spite of a wellknown cast it is not a movie for mass consumption after all how many people out for an evenings light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionallypompous intellectual film about poker and wall building nevertheless as is often the case with movies such as this theres more to the music of chance than can be seen with the first casual glance an investment of time is needed and for the most part rewarded\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination.\\nDon't look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there (although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President's attention. What's even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on. He's nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it's a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn't have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who. In the climactic \\\"match,\\\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \\\"cornball,\\\" you ain't seen nothin' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn't boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n\",\n          \"In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \\\"Needful Things.\\\" Most of Castle Rock's residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \\\"Needful Things\\\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people's greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given.\\nIt's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work, instead relying on \\\"Ave Maria\\\" and Grieg's \\\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n\",\n          \"Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M. Emmet Walsh, Charles Durning, Joel Grey Director: Philip Haas Producers: Frederick Zollo and Dylan Sellers Screenplay: Philip Haas and Belinda Haas based on the novel by Paul Auster Music: Phillip Johnston Released by I.R.S Releasing and Trans Atlantic Entertainment\\nOn the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled stranger. This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a professional gambler. As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming \\\"sure thing\\\" poker game. Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He'll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \\\"nice guy\\\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \\\"wailing wall\\\" to the \\\"City of the World\\\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there's so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \\\"good ol' boy\\\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate's cruel whims.\\nThe film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

stacey travis give him the twelve worst students in the school and through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies hell make them into decent human beings and create a blueprint by which the entire schooland perhaps the city itselfcan be changed for the better of course the leader of the local gangs a vicious man called silverio paco christian prieto isnt pleased about this at all\\ngoing into this film i expected it to be an obligatory latesummer mindless plotless action films i was wrong its a latesummer mindless plotless action film with a message i think i prefer this sorts of film when it doesnt try to preach somehow sermonizing and beating peoples brains in dont make an appealing combination\\ndont look for even a whiff of originality in this film it takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others needless to say this leads to a lot of confusion and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable deadends not that youre likely to care but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with luis girlfriend dianna stacey travis or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep luis in line\\nthere are also a number of transitional scenes that arent there although where they got left out i dont knowthey could be on the cutting room floor for example one moment dianna is explaining to luis that theyre no longer kids and while she admires what hes trying to do its over between them since she has a new boyfriend nevertheless shortly thereafter the two are getting awfully intimate talk about a jarring turn of events\\nthen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who predictably get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher somebody should bring this miracle worker to the presidents attention whats even more astounding is that luis never gets stabbed or shot there are some token guns and knives in evidence but nothing close to what youd expect at the high school from hell guns you see would have gotten in the way of the message not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys\\nspeaking of which the script does everything it possibly can to make silverio the meanest hombre youve ever laid eyes on hes nasty sadistic and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat he deals drugs and runs a chop shop we never see him kill anyone but its a given that murder is on his resume heck for all we know he eats orphans for breakfast even i cynical viewer that i am felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this satan incarnate\\nactually paco christian prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guyif youre looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt i kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his wellmuscled chest which he like the hero shows off at every possible opportunity mark dacascos is also passable especially when he doesnt have to talk geoffrey lewis who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and tv shows does an absolutely embarrassing job as the goodhearted teacher kerrigan\\nmost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch at least compared to the rest of the movie although sometimes the action goes so fast that its difficult to figure out whos who in the climactic match the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other but even that doesnt eliminate all the confusion\\nfor those who thought the ending of scent of a woman was pure cornball you aint seen nothin yet take a look at the final scene of only the strong and youll note that its got pacinos film beaten by a long stretch of course theres a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to\\nthere is one good thing that i can say about only the strong it isnt boringor at least not too boring the message it tries to get acrossthat kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangsis laudable but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful if you want somebody to listen youd better put together something worth listening too not a movie stopping ohsobriefly in the theaters on the

needful things most of castle rocks residents discover some rare and coveted treasures withina  mickey mantle baseball card for a young boy a china figurine for a slightly offbalance woman a magnificent chalice for a priest and a necklace that can take away an arthritics pain the price asked by mr gaunt is always more than reasonable at least where money is concerned and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal so be it the only one immune to needful things appears to be alan pangborn ed harris the local chief of police so when the carnage starts its up to him to stop it\\nhow is it that a film with a good cast stylish direction and camera work and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question needful things would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is\\nwhat at the outset is the films strength turns into its greatest liability the basic concept is solid a gentleseeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite peoples greed to turn them against one another unfortunately once that has happened the movie doesnt know where to go with the story so it turns to the old hollywood standbys of a pyrotechnics show a lot of dumb dialogue and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many\\nthe final scene isnt the problem its the one that immediately precedes it this is so dumb that i felt like yelling at the screen the big payoff in needful things is a gyp and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches those that sit through this picture deserve more than theyre given\\nits too bad about the climax because the bulk of the overlylong film shows promise there are the usual horror staples like the meat cleaver in the head and the shocktactic swell of music but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands the terror here is more psychological than physical and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of castle rock leland gaunt only causes it to surface\\nmax von sydow is an inspired casting choice and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about needful things he manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience offbalance hes the bad guy all righttheres never any doubt about thatbut hes so cultured and smooth and delivers the oneliners so bitingly that its almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him certainly its von sydows rendering of gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious\\ned harris bonnie bedelia and amanda plummer have shown great ability in the past but none of that is evident here the best of the three is bedelia and her role is relatively small plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature harris whos supposed to be playing the heroic lawman is about as potent as a limp noodle\\nif he hasnt done so well with three of the four main actors at least firsttime feature director fraser c heston son of charlton can boast excellent cinematography by tony westman and a creepy atmosphere needful things consistently looks nice even during its most banal scenes some of the choppy pacing is clearly hestons fault but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame\\nin the three kenneth branagh films he scored henry v dead again and this summers much ado about nothing patrick doyle showed significant versatility and range sadly the same ability is not in evidence here where doyle reworks his dead again music into an overwrought theme that at best does little for the film there are a couple of effective musical sequences but neither uses doyles work instead relying on ave maria and griegs in the hall of the mountain king\\nneedful things is another example of a good idea gone awry this seems to happen with alarming frequency when a stephen king story is involved

Shapiro, and Steven G. Menkin Screenplay: Sheldon Lettich and Luis Esteban Music: Harvey W. Mason Released by Twentieth Century Fox\\nLuis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs. Determined to do all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis): give him the twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies, he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed for the better. Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at all.\\nGoing into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action films. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message. I think I prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach. Somehow, sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination.\\nDon't look for even a whiff of originality in this film. It takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others. Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends. Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend Dianna (Stacey Travis)? Or how about the bad guys threatening her to keep Luis in line?\\nThere are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there (although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the cutting room floor). For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully intimate. Talk about a jarring turn of events....\\nThen there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably, get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their masterful teacher. Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the President's attention. What's even more astounding is that Luis never gets stabbed or shot. There are some token guns and knives in evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School from Hell. Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message, not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys.\\nSpeaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on. He's nasty, sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat. He deals drugs and runs a chop shop. We never see him kill anyone, but it's a given that murder is on his resume. Heck, for all we know, he eats orphans for breakfast. Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.\\nActually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt. I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at every possible opportunity). Mark Dacascos is also passable, especially when he doesn't have to talk. Geoffrey Lewis, who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.\\nMost of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who. In the climactic \\\"match,\\\" the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion.\\nFor those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure \\\"cornball,\\\" you ain't seen nothin' yet. Take a look at the final scene of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten by a long stretch. Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to.\\nThere is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG. It isn't boring--or at least not too boring. The message it tries to get across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium chosen for presenting it is awful. If you want somebody to listen, you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.\\n\",\n          \"In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to open an antique shop called \\\"Needful Things.\\\" Most of Castle Rock's residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956 Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain. The price asked by Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the deal, so be it. The only one immune to \\\"Needful Things\\\" appears to be Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.\\nHow is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre? Perhaps if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion picture experience than it actually is.\\nWhat at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest liability. The basic concept is solid: a gentle-seeming yet truly sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite people's greed to turn them against one another. Unfortunately, once that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story, so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.\\nThe final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately precedes it. This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen. The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the film down a couple of notches. Those that sit through this picture deserve more than they're given.\\nIt's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long film shows promise. There are the usual horror staples, like the meat cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the villain of the piece never dirties his hands. The terror here is more psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock. Leland Gaunt only causes it to surface.\\nMax von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS. He manages a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance. He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly, that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him. Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.\\nEd Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great ability in the past, but none of that is evident here. The best of the three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small. Plummer is so bad that she comes close to creating a caricature. Harris, who's supposed to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.\\nIf he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton) can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy atmosphere. NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its most banal scenes. Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.\\nIn the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed significant versatility and range. Sadly, the same ability is not in evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film. There are a couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work, instead relying on \\\"Ave Maria\\\" and Grieg's \\\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\\".\\nNEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry. This seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is involved. Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not this trait is indicative of his books. Whatever the case, in Leland Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing villains. This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't there. By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be wondering if that was really everything. Sadly, the answer is yes, but at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of Max von Sydow.\\n\",\n          \"Starring: Mandy Patinkin, James Spader, M. Emmet Walsh, Charles Durning, Joel Grey Director: Philip Haas Producers: Frederick Zollo and Dylan Sellers Screenplay: Philip Haas and Belinda Haas based on the novel by Paul Auster Music: Phillip Johnston Released by I.R.S Releasing and Trans Atlantic Entertainment\\nOn the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled stranger. This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a professional gambler. As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to use in an upcoming \\\"sure thing\\\" poker game. Intrigued by the idea of some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition. He'll advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty. The deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games begin.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels. At its most literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which include building a ten-thousand stone wall. However, those that choose to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather dry and stale experience. While final scene, dripping with meaning, gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot of questions left unanswered.\\nPeel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies just beneath it. There you will find other questions, but these are of a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature. THE MUSIC OF CHANCE explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives. It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to trust.\\nAt the center of the story are three characters. James Nashe is the basic \\\"nice guy\\\" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of the cost. He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he deserves. On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with. Calvin Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can deny.\\nMetaphors abound, from the \\\"wailing wall\\\" to the \\\"City of the World\\\" being built by Willie Stone. In fact, there's so much symbolism that little in this movie has a single meaning. There are times when the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.\\nCharacter motivation and interaction are driving forces, and necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF CHANCE. As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are completely understandable. Calvin Murks starts out as something of an enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip out.\\nJames Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack. M. Emmet Walsh does his usual \\\"good ol' boy\\\" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner. The standout, however, is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and battered by fate's cruel whims.\\nThe film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness. Aside from being relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory. Movies such as this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the whole to come together. Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and how it all ends up.\\nTHE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption. After all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about poker and wall building? Nevertheless, as is often the case with movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be seen with the first casual glance. An investment of time is needed and, for the most part, rewarded.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
